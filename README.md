### Note: this project is under active development

This repository contains a number of idempotent Ansible modules that can be used to manage a Cisco ACI network fabric.

Current modules include:
* aci_tenant
* aci_context
* aci_bridge_domain
* aci_contract
* aci_contract_subject

The best way to see examples are in the `aci-demo.yml` playbook as well as the examples located within the modules.

New modules will be added in the coming weeks as these continue to be re factored and optimized.
